2025-06-25 14:51:21,426 [INFO] Claim: Modi killed Rahul Gandhi
2025-06-25 14:51:21,426 [INFO] Result: Guwahati: Shri Rahul Gandhi, while addressing an election rally in Bengali-speaking migrant Muslim majority Chaygaon constituency in Assam s Kamrup district, said, Deepanjal had stood peacefully for Assam but RSS-BJP shot him dead. For what he sacrificed his life, we will never allow that (CAA) be implemented. (Referring to Deepanjal Das, an anti-CAA protestor from Chaygaon who was killed in police firing in Guwahati in December 2019.) In another rally in Barkhetri constituency in Nalbari district, the Congress scion alleged that Modi had dried up employment avenues, particularly in Assam, through demonetisation and imposition of GST and other taxes. Modi has finished all employment avenues and handed over your airports, tea gardens and even oil to his two-three industrialist friends, he said.

      "supports_claim": false,
      "explanation": "The result does not support the claim that 'Modi killed Rahul Gandhi'. Instead, it provides information about a statement made by Rahul Gandhi at election rallies in Assam regarding employment opportunities and alleged favoritism to industrialist friends. The death of Deepanjal Das is mentioned as an example of opposition to the CAA, but there is no mention or implication that Modi was involved in his death."

The ceasefire suggests that neither side has achieved a decisive victory yet."
   }

In this case, the provided result from AP News reports about a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran following an Iranian missile attack on a U.S. military base in Qatar. This ceasefire implies that neither Israel nor Iran can be considered as having won the war, as it was only a temporary halt to the conflict. Furthermore, the article mentions that the status of a possible long-term ceasefire remains tentative. As such, the result does not support the claim that Iran lost the war against Israel in 2025.

2025-06-27 13:57:50,368 [INFO] Claim: A post is rapidly going viral on social media, claiming that the central government has decided to impose toll tax on two-wheelers. It is being presented as a move that will burden the common people, especially the middle class and economically weaker sections who primarily rely on two-wheelers for daily commuting. The post also claims that this new policy will be implemented starting July 15, and is being criticized for unfairly targeting those who are already financially vulnerable.

2025-06-27 15:42:04,683 [INFO] Claim: A post is rapidly going viral on social media, claiming that the central government has decided to impose toll tax on two-wheelers. It is being presented as a move that will burden the common people, especially the middle class and economically weaker sections who primarily rely on two-wheelers for daily commuting. The post also claims that this new policy will be implemented starting July 15, and is being criticized for unfairly targeting those who are already financially vulnerable

The article 'Fact Check: British F-35B jet grounded in India due to repair logistics, not design flaw' from DFRAC (Digital Forensics, Research and Analytics Center) states that the jet had an emergency landing in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, on June 14 due to bad weather and low fuel. After landing, a hydraulic snag was discovered which required specialized equipment and personnel from the UK to fix. The article further confirms that the jet has remained grounded as logistical arrangements are being made to tow it to a maintenance hangar at the airport. This contradicts the claim that the jet was grounded due to design flaws."
